<h1>My favorite movies to watch with my wife, Marrissa</h1>

<h2>I hope that I will have the chance to watch these again soon</h2>

<h3>Kung Fu Panda</h3>
<p>I enjoy watching Po learn his new skills,
     even though everyone thought he was a joke.</p>
<h3>Luca</h3>
<p>A story of a sea monster in the italian peninsula who yearns to be a normal boy
</p>
<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>An all-time classic, can't get enough of the swamp life!</p>
